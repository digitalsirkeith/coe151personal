# CoE 151 MP1 Implementation
Important notes on implementation:
- This is not supported on Windows unfortunately due to select() taking nothing but sockets. I request this be tested on Unix machines.

RFC Protocol:
- The protocol our class follows can be seen [here](https://github.com/digitalsirkeith/coe151/blob/master/protocol/README.txt).
- A prettified version of the same protocol can be seen [here](https://digitalsirkeith.github.io/coe151/mp1protocol.html).
- Please do note of the expiration date as we have not modified it since March 2020.
